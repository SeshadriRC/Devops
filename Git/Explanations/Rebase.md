Here’s a clear, simple explanation 👇

### 💡 **Layman’s Explanation**

Imagine you and your friend are writing a story together.
You both start from the same beginning (main branch).
You write a few paragraphs in your copy (`feature` branch), and your friend keeps writing new paragraphs in the main story (`main` branch).

Now, when you want to combine your version with the latest story, you can either:

* **Merge** → Just stick both versions together with a note (“Seshadri added changes here”).
* **Rebase** → Move your paragraphs **on top** of the newest story, as if you wrote them after your friend finished theirs — making the story look like a clean, continuous timeline.

That “moving your commits on top of another branch” is called **rebase**.

### ⚙️ **Technical Meaning**

`git rebase` takes the commits from your branch and **reapplies them** on top of another branch (usually `main`), creating a **linear commit history** (no merge commits).

---

### 🧩 **Example**

Let’s say you have:

```
main:     A --- B --- C
feature:       \ 
                D --- E
```

Now someone adds new commits `F` and `G` to main:

```
main:     A --- B --- C --- F --- G
feature:       \ 
                D --- E
```

If you do:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

Git will take commits D and E and move them **on top of G**:

```
main:     A --- B --- C --- F --- G --- D' --- E'
```

Your branch now looks as if you started from the latest `main`, keeping history neat and linear.

| Command                 | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `git rebase main`       | Move current branch commits on top of `main` |

### ✅ **In Short**

> **`git rebase`** = “Replay my changes on top of another branch to make history cleaner.”
