Sarah and Max were working on writting some stories which they have pushed to the repository. Max has recently added some new changes and is trying to push them to the repository but he is facing some issues. Below you can find more details:


SSH into storage server using user max and password Max_pass123. Under /home/max you will find the story-blog repository. Try to push the changes to the origin repo and fix the issues. The story-index.txt must have titles for all 4 stories. Additionally, there is a typo in The Lion and the Mooose line where Mooose should be Mouse.


Click on the Gitea UI button on the top bar. You should be able to access the Gitea page. You can login to Gitea server from UI using username sarah and password Sarah_pass123 or username max and password Max_pass123.


Note: For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

## Solution

```
edit the file , commit it

git pull origin master --rebase  - u will get error
git rebase --continue


```

```
max (master)$ git push
Username for 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': max
Password for 'http://max@git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': 
To http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing

```
```
max ((no branch, rebasing master))$ git fetch origin
max ((no branch, rebasing master))$ git pull --rebase origin master
error: Pull is not possible because you have unmerged files.

fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
max ((no branch, rebasing master))$ git branch
* (no branch, rebasing master)
  master
max ((no branch, rebasing master))$
```

Perfect — you’ve hit a **merge conflict during rebase**, so Git stopped and put you in a **detached HEAD** state (`(no branch, rebasing master)`). That’s normal 👍

Now you just need to **resolve the conflicts, then continue the rebase**.

---

### 🔹 Steps to Resolve the Conflict

1. **See which files are conflicted**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   * It will show files under **“Unmerged paths”**.

2. **Open each conflicted file**
   Example:

   ```bash
   nano story-index.txt
   ```

   Inside, you’ll see markers like this:

   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   (Sarah’s version)
   =======
   (Max’s version)
   >>>>>>> <commit_id>
   ```

   ✅ Edit the file to remove the markers and keep the correct/final content
   (make sure `story-index.txt` has all 4 story titles, and `The Lion and the Mouse` is spelled correctly).

3. **Mark the file as resolved**

   ```bash
   git add story-index.txt
   git add The-Lion-and-the-Mooose.txt
   ```

   (Add all conflicted files after fixing them.)

4. **Continue the rebase**

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   * If there are more conflicts, repeat steps 1–4 until finished.

5. **Once rebase finishes successfully, push the changes**

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

---

⚠️ Right now, you’re stuck in a **rebase**. Don’t do `git commit` directly — always use `git rebase --continue` after fixing conflicts.

👉 Do you want me to also give you a **quick one-liner** that lists *only the filenames currently in conflict* so you don’t have to read through the whole `git status` output?
