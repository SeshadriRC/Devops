**“Regular AI follows your step-by-step instructions, while Agentic AI figures out the best way to achieve your goal on its own.”** ✅

Sure! Let’s use a **bus ticket booking** scenario to illustrate the difference:

---

### **Regular AI Agent (reactive)**

* You say: “Book a bus ticket from City A to City B on June 10.”
* The AI asks you for details step by step (time, seat preference, payment) and **just follows your instructions**.
* It **doesn’t decide anything on its own**, just reacts to your commands.

---

### **Agentic AI (proactive & goal-driven)**

* You say: “Book me a bus ticket from City A to City B on June 10.”

* The AI goes further:

  1. Checks **all bus options** and compares prices and timings.
  2. Chooses the **best seat** based on your past preferences.
  3. Completes the **payment** automatically.
  4. Sends you a **confirmation with reminders** before departure.
  5. Optionally **adjusts your booking** if a faster or cheaper bus appears.

* Here, it’s **planning, deciding, and acting on multiple steps** without waiting for your input at every stage.

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

* Regular AI = does **what you say**.
* Agentic AI = does **what you need done**, including steps you didn’t explicitly tell it.

If you want, I can give **2–3 more real-world, everyday examples** like this for Agentic AI—it’s useful for explaining it quickly in simple terms. Do you want me to do that?
