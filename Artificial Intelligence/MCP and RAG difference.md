Here’s a clear visual representation of **how MCP and RAG work together in a chatbot pipeline**:

```
User Input

+---------------------+
|  MCP (Context Layer) |
| - Stores conversation history         |
| - Retrieves relevant past context    |

|  RAG (Retrieval Layer) |

| Language Model (Generation) |

### **Explanation**

1. **MCP (Context Layer)**

   * Keeps track of **conversation history**
   * Ensures **multi-turn coherence**

2. **RAG (Retrieval Layer)**

   * Fetches **external knowledge** needed to answer questions
   * Reduces hallucinations

3. **Language Model**

   * Uses **both MCP and RAG inputs** to generate a response that is:

     * **Contextually coherent** (thanks to MCP)
     * **Factual and up-to-date** (thanks to RAG)

---

💡 **Key takeaway for interviews:**

> “MCP handles memory and context for coherent multi-turn conversations, while RAG augments the model with external knowledge to ensure accuracy. Together, they enable chatbots and AI systems to provide context-aware and factually correct responses.”

If you want, I can also **make a simpler, one-line analogy diagram** that’s very easy to explain verbally in an interview.

Do you want me to do that?
