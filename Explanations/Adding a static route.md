That command is **adding a static route** to your system’s routing table. Let’s decode it:

```
sudo ip route add 172.16.238.0/24 via 172.16.239.1
```

* **sudo** → run as root (needed for networking changes).
* **ip route add** → add a new route.
* **172.16.238.0/24** → the destination network (all IPs from 172.16.238.0 to 172.16.238.255).
* **via 172.16.239.1** → the next-hop (gateway) IP to reach that network.

👉 Meaning:
“To reach the `172.16.238.0/24` network, send traffic to the router/gateway at `172.16.239.1`.”

⚠️ Notes:

* Like with `ip addr add`, this route is **temporary** — it disappears after reboot or network restart.
* To make it permanent, you must add it to your network configuration files (e.g., `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0` on RHEL/CentOS or `/etc/netplan/` on Ubuntu).

Would you like me to show you the exact way to make this route permanent in **CentOS/RHEL** and **Ubuntu**?
