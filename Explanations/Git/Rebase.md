[Rebase](https://github.com/SeshadriRC/Devops/blob/main/100-days-of-Devops/Day32%3A%20Git%20Rebase.md)

Got it ✅ — here’s what you need to do step by step for this **git rebase** task:

---

### 1. Go to the cloned repo

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
```

### 2. Verify the current branch

Check which branch you are on:

```bash
git status
```

If you are **not** on the feature branch, switch to it:

```bash
git checkout feature
```

### 3. Fetch latest updates

Always sync with remote before rebasing:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 4. Rebase feature branch with master

Now, rebase the `feature` branch on top of the latest `master` branch:

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

* If there are **conflicts**, Git will stop and show the files.
* Resolve conflicts manually, then run:

  ```bash
  git add <file>
  git rebase --continue
  ```
* If you want to abort:

  ```bash
  git rebase --abort
  ```

### 5. Push changes back

Since rebase rewrites commit history, you need to push with `--force`:

```bash
git push origin feature --force
```

---

✅ This way, the **feature branch history is updated on top of master without merge commits**, and no work from the feature branch is lost.

Do you want me to also explain **why rebase is preferred over merge** here?

Perfect 👍 thanks for sharing the `git log`.

Right now your **feature branch** has only 2 commits:

1. `9a7c127` → "Add new feature" (feature branch work)
2. `3ea6f26` → "initial commit"

But you mentioned that **master branch has some new commits** that need to be on top of your feature branch (without a merge commit).

---

Here’s exactly what you need to do next:

### 1. Make sure you’re on feature branch

```bash
git checkout feature
```

### 2. Fetch the latest commits

```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 3. Rebase your feature branch onto master

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

* This will **reapply your “Add new feature” commit on top of master’s latest commits**.
* If there are conflicts, fix them → `git add <file>` → `git rebase --continue`.

### 4. Push the rebased branch back

Since the history has been rewritten:

```bash
git push origin feature --force
```

---

👉 After this, `git log --oneline --graph --all` will show your `feature` branch commits on top of master’s latest commits, with no merge commit.

Do you want me to show you how the `git log` will look *before vs after rebase* so you can verify?


Great 👍 Let me show you how the history will look **before vs after rebase**.

---

### 🔹 Before rebase

Right now your **feature** branch diverges from **master**:

```text
(feature branch commits)
* 9a7c127 Add new feature       <-- feature (HEAD)
|
* 3ea6f26 initial commit
```

Meanwhile, the **master** branch has progressed with new commits (example):

```text
(master branch commits)
* a1b2c3d Fix bug in login       <-- master
* d4e5f6a Update README
* 3ea6f26 initial commit
```

So visually it looks like this (branches diverged):

```text
feature:  9a7c127 Add new feature
          /
master:  a1b2c3d Fix bug in login
         d4e5f6a Update README
         3ea6f26 initial commit
```

---

### 🔹 After rebase

When you run:

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

Git takes your `feature` branch commits (`Add new feature`) and **reapplies them on top of master’s latest commit**:

```text
* 1112223 Add new feature        <-- feature
* a1b2c3d Fix bug in login       <-- master
* d4e5f6a Update README
* 3ea6f26 initial commit
```

Notice:

* Your commit `Add new feature` now has a **new commit hash** (since it was replayed).
* No merge commit was introduced.
* History is clean and linear.

---

✅ To confirm after rebase, run:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

You’ll see feature’s commit on top of master’s.

---

Do you want me to also give you the **exact commands** you can run now on your repo to rebase + verify?


Thanks for sharing both logs 🙌 — now it’s crystal clear.

---

### Current situation

**feature branch log**:

```text
* 9a7c127 Add new feature   <-- feature
* 3ea6f26 initial commit
```

**master branch log**:

```text
* 59e8850 Update info.txt   <-- master
* 3ea6f26 initial commit
```

So:

* `feature` has **Add new feature**.
* `master` has **Update info.txt**.
* Both branched off from the same `initial commit`.

---

### After rebase (what we want)

When you rebase `feature` onto `master`, Git will **replay your “Add new feature” commit on top of “Update info.txt”**.

Resulting history:

```text
* NEW_HASH  Add new feature      <-- feature
* 59e8850   Update info.txt      <-- master
* 3ea6f26   initial commit
```

* Your feature commit (`9a7c127`) will be rewritten with a **new commit hash** (because of rebase).
* History will be clean and linear — no merge commit.

---

### Commands to run

```bash
# make sure you’re on feature
git checkout feature

# fetch latest from remote
git fetch origin

# rebase feature onto master
git rebase origin/master

# push rebased branch (force required)
git push origin feature --force
```

---

✅ After this, `git log --oneline --graph --all` will show feature’s commit on top of master’s.

Do you want me to also show you the **exact git log graph output** you’ll see after rebase, so you can match it?


Perfect 👍 thanks for showing the graph.

Right now it clearly shows the **divergence**:

```text
* 9a7c127 (feature)       Add new feature
| 
* 59e8850 (master)        Update info.txt
|/
* 3ea6f26                 initial commit
```

---

### What happens after rebase

When you run:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase master
```

Git will take the commit `Add new feature` (9a7c127) and **replay it on top of master’s latest commit (59e8850)**.

So the history will become:

```text
* NEW_HASH  (feature)     Add new feature
* 59e8850   (master)      Update info.txt
* 3ea6f26                 initial commit
```

---

### Push after rebase

Since the commit hash changes, you need to force push:

```bash
git push origin feature --force
```

---

✅ Then if you run:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

You’ll see a nice linear history — feature’s commit sitting right above master’s commit.

---

Do you want me to give you the **exact final `git log --graph` output** you should see after rebase so you can verify instantly?


Good question 👍 — this is the key difference.

---

### 🔹 If you used **merge**

From your current state:

```text
* 9a7c127 (feature)   Add new feature
| 
* 59e8850 (master)    Update info.txt
|/
* 3ea6f26             initial commit
```

If you did:

```bash
git checkout feature
git merge master
```

Git would create a **new merge commit** to combine histories:

```text
*   abcd123 (feature) Merge branch 'master' into feature
|\
| * 59e8850 (master)  Update info.txt
* | 9a7c127           Add new feature
|/
* 3ea6f26             initial commit
```

* ✅ Both changes are preserved.
* ❌ But the history now has an **extra merge commit** (`abcd123`), making it less clean.
* ❌ The timeline looks “branched” even though the work is just sequential.

---

### 🔹 With **rebase**

When you do:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase master
```

History becomes linear:

```text
* NEW_HASH (feature)  Add new feature
* 59e8850 (master)    Update info.txt
* 3ea6f26             initial commit
```

* ✅ No merge commit.
* ✅ Feature branch looks like it was built *after* master’s changes (even though it wasn’t originally).
* ✅ Cleaner, linear history, easy to read.

---

### 📌 Why rebase here?

* The developer wanted to **keep feature commits on top of master**.
* They explicitly did **not want a merge commit**.
* Rebase preserves feature branch commits while making the history look like the feature branch started from the latest master commit.

---

👉 So:

* Use **merge** when you want to preserve the exact history (and don’t care about extra merge commits).
* Use **rebase** when you want a **clean, linear history** without merge commits.

---

Would you like me to also explain **when not to use rebase** (like on `master` or shared branches)?


Great 👍 this is an important nuance.

---

## 🔹 When **NOT** to use `git rebase`

Rebase is powerful, but it **rewrites history** (changes commit hashes). That’s safe only if nobody else is depending on that history.

Here are the main cases where **you should avoid rebase**:

---

### 1. **On shared/public branches** (e.g. `master`, `main`, `develop`)

* If you rebase `master`, you rewrite its commit history.
* Anyone who already pulled `master` will now have a different commit history → leading to conflicts and confusion.

👉 Rule: **Never rebase public branches** that teammates are already using.

---

### 2. **When commits are already pushed and shared**

* If you pushed a branch to the remote and your teammates already pulled it, then rebasing will rewrite its commit hashes.
* Your teammates will need to force-pull and fix conflicts — messy.

👉 Safe rule: **Only rebase private branches** (your own feature branch that nobody else is working on yet).

---

### 3. **When preserving history is important**

* Rebase creates a “clean history” but it also hides the fact that the feature branch diverged.
* If you need an **accurate history of how development happened** (e.g., in an audit trail), rebase may not be desirable.
* A merge commit is sometimes better for traceability.

---

## 🔹 When rebase is **safe and useful**

* On **your local feature branch** before pushing.
* When you want to update your branch with the latest `master` without clutter.
* To “clean up” a messy commit history before sharing with others (e.g., squash + rebase).

---

✅ So the golden rule:
**Don’t rebase shared history. Rebase only your local/private feature branches.**

---

Do you want me to also compare **rebase vs merge in team workflows** (like GitHub PRs) so you know which to use when collaborating?
