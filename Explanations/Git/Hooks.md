Good question 👍

In **Git**, **hooks** are **scripts that run automatically** when certain events happen inside a repository.

They live inside the repository’s `.git/hooks/` directory (for a bare repo like `/opt/official.git`, it’s directly `/opt/official.git/hooks`).

---

### 🔑 Key Points:

* A hook is just an **executable script** (usually shell, but can be Python, Perl, etc.).
* They allow you to **customize Git’s behavior** and automate tasks.
* Git provides **sample hook files** (like `pre-commit.sample`) inside `.git/hooks/`. You just remove `.sample` and make them executable to activate.

---

### 📌 Common Types of Hooks:

Hooks are divided into **client-side** and **server-side**.

#### **Client-side hooks** (run on developer machine)

* `pre-commit` → runs before a commit is created (used for linting, code style checks).
* `commit-msg` → checks the commit message (enforce format, ticket IDs).
* `post-commit` → runs after a commit is made.

#### **Server-side hooks** (run on the Git server, e.g., bare repo in `/opt/official.git`)

* `pre-receive` → runs before changes are accepted.
* `update` → runs when a branch is updated.
* `post-update` → runs after changes are pushed (used to trigger builds, create tags, notify systems).

---

### ⚡ Example Use Cases

* **Enforce coding standards** before committing (`pre-commit` runs lint/test).
* **Reject bad commit messages** using `commit-msg`.
* **Automatically deploy code** after push using `post-update`.
* **Send notifications / trigger CI pipelines** when new code is pushed.

---

👉 In your case, we created a **`post-update` hook** so that *whenever someone pushes to `master`*, Git automatically creates a release tag with today’s date.

---

Do you want me to also compare **hooks in local repo vs hooks in bare repo (server-side)** so it’s crystal clear for your Nautilus task?


Perfect 👍 Let’s break it down —

---

## 🔹 Hooks in **Local Repositories**

(Local repo = has working directory, e.g. `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos`)

* These hooks run on a **developer’s machine**.
* Examples:

  * **`pre-commit`** → check code style, run tests before commit.
  * **`commit-msg`** → enforce commit message format.
  * **`post-commit`** → send a desktop notification after commit.
* They can **see and modify the working directory**, because local repos have code files.
* **Not shared**: if you clone a repo, hooks are not cloned by default. (They live only in `.git/hooks/` locally.)

👉 Use case: Prevent a dev from committing bad code or wrong commit messages.

---

## 🔹 Hooks in **Bare Repositories**

(Bare repo = no working directory, e.g. `/opt/official.git`)

* These hooks run on the **central remote server** when someone pushes code.
* Examples:

  * **`pre-receive`** → reject a push if policy fails (e.g., no force-push to master).
  * **`update`** → validate each branch update during push.
  * **`post-update`** → trigger actions *after* a successful push (CI/CD, tagging, deployment).
* Since bare repos don’t have working files, hooks here can’t compile or test code directly. They usually handle:

  * Access control
  * Tagging releases
  * Deployments
  * Notifications (Slack/email/CI pipeline)

👉 In your task, we used a **`post-update` hook in `/opt/official.git`** to auto-create a release tag whenever code is pushed to `master`.

## 📌 Big Difference

| Aspect           | Local Repo Hooks                          | Bare Repo Hooks (Server-side)          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Run location     | On dev machine (when committing, merging) | On central server (when pushing)       |
| Has working dir? | ✅ Yes                                     | ❌ No                                   |
| Typical use      | Code quality, commit policies             | Access rules, CI/CD, deployments, tags |
| Shared?          | ❌ Each dev must set them up manually      | ✅ Affects everyone pushing to remote   |

---

👉 So in Nautilus:

* Devs use `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` (local repo) → no hooks needed there for tagging.
* The server repo `/opt/official.git` (bare repo) has the **post-update hook** → ensures release tags are always created centrally when master is updated.

Do you also want me to show you a **real push workflow diagram** (local → bare repo → hook triggered → release tag created) so it’s visual?
