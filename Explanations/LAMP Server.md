A **LAMP server** is a software stack commonly used for hosting dynamic websites and web applications.

The term **LAMP** is an acronym that stands for:

* **L** â†’ **Linux** â†’ the operating system
* **A** â†’ **Apache** â†’ the web server software that serves web pages
* **M** â†’ **MySQL/MariaDB** â†’ the database management system for storing data
* **P** â†’ **PHP** (sometimes **Perl** or **Python**) â†’ the programming language used to build dynamic web applications

So, a **LAMP server** is essentially a Linux-based server configured with **Apache, MySQL (or MariaDB), and PHP** to deliver dynamic, database-driven websites (like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal).

ðŸ‘‰ For example, if you install Ubuntu Server, set up Apache to serve web pages, MySQL to handle the database, and PHP to process scripts â€” youâ€™ve built a **LAMP server**.

Do you want me to also explain how it compares with **LEMP (Nginx instead of Apache)**?
