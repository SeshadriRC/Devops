We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.



Create a pod named volume-share-nautilus.


For the first container, use image fedora with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e fedora:latest, container should be named as volume-container-nautilus-1, and run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/media.


For the second container, use image fedora with the latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e fedora:latest, container should be named as volume-container-nautilus-2, and again run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/games.


Volume name should be volume-share of type emptyDir.


After creating the pod, exec into the first container i.e volume-container-nautilus-1, and just for testing create a file media.txt with any content under the mounted path of first container i.e /tmp/media.


The file media.txt should be present under the mounted path /tmp/games on the second container volume-container-nautilus-2 as well, since they are using a shared volume.


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


## Solution

Below is the **exact, step-by-step solution** to meet all the requirements. You can run everything from the **jump_host** since `kubectl` is already configured.

## 1️⃣ Create the Pod with a shared `emptyDir` volume

Create a YAML file (for example: `volume-share-nautilus.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-share-nautilus
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: volume-share
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: volume-container-nautilus-1
      image: fedora:latest
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume-share
          mountPath: /tmp/media

    - name: volume-container-nautilus-2
      image: fedora:latest
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume-share
          mountPath: /tmp/games
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f volume-share-nautilus.yaml
```

Verify pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pod volume-share-nautilus
```

---

## 2️⃣ Exec into the first container and create the file

Exec into **volume-container-nautilus-1**:

```bash
kubectl exec -it volume-share-nautilus -c volume-container-nautilus-1 -- bash
```

Inside the container:

```bash
echo "This is shared volume test" > /tmp/media/media.txt
exit
```

---

## 3️⃣ Verify the file from the second container

Exec into **volume-container-nautilus-2**:

```bash
kubectl exec -it volume-share-nautilus -c volume-container-nautilus-2 -- bash
```

Check the file:

```bash
cat /tmp/games/media.txt
```

✅ You should see the same content, confirming that both containers are sharing the **same emptyDir volume**.

---

## 🔍 Key Concept (for clarity)

* `emptyDir` volume is **created when the pod starts**
* It is **shared by all containers in the same pod**
* Data exists **only for the lifetime of the pod**
* Different mount paths → **same underlying storage**
