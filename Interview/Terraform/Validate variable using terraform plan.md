Question: How to validate the variable during terraform plan time? Example you take a variable called AMI. We need to make sure its of a proper format.

Good question üëè ‚Äî You‚Äôre referring to **variable validation** in Terraform, which is used to ensure that inputs (like AMI IDs) follow the right pattern *before* applying changes ‚Äî i.e., at **plan time**.

Let‚Äôs fix and explain your example clearly üëá

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct Terraform Variable Example (with validation)**

```hcl
variable "ami" {
  type        = string
  description = "EC2 instance AMI ID"
  default     = "ami-90394321875931"

  validation {
    condition     = length(var.ami) > 4 && substr(var.ami, 0, 4) == "ami-"
    error_message = "Enter a proper AMI ID. It should start with 'ami-' and be longer than 4 characters."
  }
}
```

### üß© **Explanation**

| Field           | Meaning                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validation`    | Used to define checks that must be true for the variable to be valid.                                 |
| `condition`     | The logic to test. If this evaluates to **false**, Terraform throws an error during `terraform plan`. |
| `error_message` | Custom error message shown to the user when validation fails.                                         |

---

### üí° **Condition Breakdown**

```hcl
length(var.ami) > 4
```

‚Üí Ensures it‚Äôs not too short.

```hcl
substr(var.ami, 0, 4) == "ami-"
```

‚Üí Ensures the AMI ID **starts with "ami-"**.

Both conditions must be true (`&&`).

### üß™ **Test Results**

| Input       | Result                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `ami-01234` | ‚úÖ Passes               |
| `ami-xyz`   | ‚úÖ Passes               |
| `ame-01234` | ‚ùå Fails (wrong prefix) |
| `ami-`      | ‚ùå Fails (too short)    |

---

### üó£ **Layman summary**

> Terraform checks your variable before deploying ‚Äî like a spell-check for your inputs.
> Here, it ensures the AMI starts with ‚Äúami-‚Äù and isn‚Äôt too short. If not, Terraform stops at plan time and shows the custom error message.

Would you like me to show a **regex-based validation** version too (for more precise AMI format like `ami-[0-9a-f]{8,17}`)?
