What are the load balancers in AWS. Briefly explain which one you have used and uses cases of others. give me in layman terms and in interview perspective

Here’s a clear **interview-style answer in layman terms** for AWS load balancers 👇

---

### **Load Balancers in AWS**

AWS provides different types of **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets (like EC2 instances, containers, IPs) for **high availability and fault tolerance**.

---

### **1️⃣ Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**

* **Oldest** generation load balancer.
* Works at **Layer 4 (TCP)** and **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**.
* **Limited features**, supports basic routing only (no path-based or host-based).
* **Will be deprecated from August 2022**, so AWS recommends using ALB or NLB instead.

🟢 **Use case (earlier days)**: Simple web applications with HTTP/HTTPS traffic and no advanced routing needs.

---

### **2️⃣ Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

* Works at **Layer 7 (Application layer)** — understands HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
* Supports **path-based** and **host-based routing**

  * Example:

    * `/home` → Home page backend
    * `/mobile` → Mobile app backend
* Supports **multiple target groups** and **multiple Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)**.
* Ideal for **modern web apps and microservices**.

🟢 **Use case (commonly used)**:
I’ve used **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in my projects for:

* Web applications running on multiple EC2 instances or ECS containers.
* Routing traffic based on URL paths (e.g., `/api`, `/admin`).
* Managing SSL termination and session stickiness.

---

### **3️⃣ Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

* Works at **Layer 4 (Network layer)** — handles TCP, UDP, and TLS.
* Very **fast** and can handle **millions of requests per second** with **ultra-low latency**.
* Used when you need **static IPs** or **high-performance** load balancing.

🟢 **Use case**:
Streaming applications, gaming servers, or financial systems where **speed and performance** matter more than advanced routing logic.

---

### **4️⃣ Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**

* Works at **Layer 3 (Network layer)**.
* Designed for **security and network appliances** — like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or deep packet inspection tools.
* Uses **GENEVE protocol on port 6081** for encapsulation.

🟢 **Use case**:
Used in **security-focused environments**, where all traffic must pass through a **security appliance** before reaching applications.

---

### **Bonus: Traffic Routing Algorithm**

* **Round Robin** – Default routing method; it sends requests to each target **one by one** in rotation.

### ✅ **Summary Table**

| Load Balancer     | Layer | Key Feature                      | Common Use Case        |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Classic (CLB)     | 4 & 7 | Basic load balancing             | Legacy apps            |
| Application (ALB) | 7     | Path/Host-based routing          | Web & microservices    |
| Network (NLB)     | 4     | High performance, TCP/UDP        | Real-time or streaming |
| Gateway (GWLB)    | 3     | Security appliances using GENEVE | Firewalls, IDS/IPS     |

### **Interview-style answer sample**

> "AWS provides four types of load balancers — Classic, Application, Network, and Gateway Load Balancers.
> In my project, I’ve mainly used **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for web applications running on multiple EC2 instances. ALB helps route traffic based on paths and hostnames, supports multiple Auto Scaling Groups, and simplifies SSL management.
> NLB is used when ultra-low latency or TCP-level performance is needed — like in streaming or gaming applications.
> GWLB is mainly for integrating third-party security appliances such as firewalls, and CLB is the old version that AWS is deprecating."
