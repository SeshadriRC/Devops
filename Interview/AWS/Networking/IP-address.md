Perfect — let’s break this **step by step**, because subnetting is often tricky if you’re moving from **on-prem networking to cloud (AWS, OpenShift, etc.)**.

---

## 🧩 Understanding `192.168.1.0/24`

### 1️⃣ What the `/24` means

* The **`/24`** is called the **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation**.
* It tells us **how many bits are used for the network portion** of the IP address.

**IPv4 addresses** are **32 bits long**, divided as:

```
Network bits | Host bits
```

* `/24` → first 24 bits are **network**, remaining 8 bits are **host**.

---

### 2️⃣ Number of IPs in `/24`

* Host bits = **32 - 24 = 8 bits**
* Number of possible host addresses = ( 2^8 = 256 )

> That’s why a `/24` subnet has **256 IPs**.

---

### 3️⃣ Why usable IPs are 254

* Out of 256 IPs:

  1. **Network address**: first IP (`192.168.1.0`) → identifies the subnet
  2. **Broadcast address**: last IP (`192.168.1.255`) → used for broadcasting to all hosts

* Remaining **256 - 2 = 254 usable IPs** for devices/servers.

---

### 4️⃣ Example IP Range

```
Network: 192.168.1.0/24
Usable IPs: 192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255
```

---

### 5️⃣ Quick Formula

1. Number of host bits = `32 - subnet mask`
2. Total IPs = `2^(host bits)`
3. Usable IPs = `2^(host bits) - 2`

**Example Table:**

| CIDR | Host bits | Total IPs | Usable IPs |
| ---- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| /30  | 2         | 4         | 2          |
| /29  | 3         | 8         | 6          |
| /28  | 4         | 16        | 14         |
| /24  | 8         | 256       | 254        |
| /16  | 16        | 65536     | 65534      |

---

💡 **Interview Tip:**

> “`192.168.1.0/24` means 256 IP addresses because 32-24=8 host bits, 2^8=256. Out of these, 254 are usable for devices; `.0` is network and `.255` is broadcast.”

---

If you want, I can also **explain why in AWS VPC a /24 subnet also reserves 5 IPs automatically** — which is a key cloud networking point.

Do you want me to explain that?





Ah — now it makes sense why you’re confused. Let’s clarify carefully — this is a **classic IPv4 subnetting misunderstanding**, especially when moving from `/24` to `/16`.

---

## 1️⃣ The Difference Between /24 and /16

### `/24` subnet:

* Host bits = 32 – 24 = 8 bits
* Total IPs = 2⁸ = 256
* Usable IPs = 256 – 2 = 254
* Range: `192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254`
* **Last octet** varies from 1 → 254
* Only the **last octet changes**, first three octets fixed: `192.168.1.X`

---

### `/16` subnet:

* Host bits = 32 – 16 = 16 bits
* Total IPs = 2¹⁶ = 65,536
* Usable IPs = 65,536 – 2 = 65,534
* Range: `192.168.0.1 → 192.168.255.254`
* **Last two octets** vary:

```
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
...
192.168.0.255
192.168.1.0
192.168.1.1
...
192.168.255.254
```

✅ Key point: **Both the 3rd and 4th octets are used to assign host addresses**.

---

## 2️⃣ How 65,534 usable IPs are “assigned”

* Third octet: 0 → 255 (256 values)
* Fourth octet: 1 → 254 (254 usable values per third octet)

**So total usable IPs:**

```
256 (third octet) × 254 (fourth octet) = 65,024?  
```

⚠ Wait, let’s calculate **properly**:

* Total IPs = 2¹⁶ = 65,536
* Minus 2 for **network** and **broadcast** → 65,534
* That’s why AWS or networking guides say **65,534 usable IPs**

The host assignment works **sequentially**:

```
192.168.0.1 → 192.168.0.254
192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254
...
192.168.255.1 → 192.168.255.254
```

---

### 3️⃣ Visualization (simplified)

```
Network: 192.168.0.0/16
Third Octet → 0 → 255
Fourth Octet → 0 → 255

Network: 192.168.0.0 (reserved)
Broadcast: 192.168.255.255 (reserved)

Usable IPs:
192.168.0.1 → 192.168.0.254
192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254
...
192.168.255.1 → 192.168.255.254
```

So even though it looks like `192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254` is only 254 IPs, that’s **just one slice (/24)** of the bigger `/16` subnet.
All 256 slices together give **65,534 usable IPs**.

---

💡 **Interview Tip:**

> “In a /16 subnet, 16 bits are for hosts. That means the **last two octets** vary, giving 65,536 total addresses. Subtract network and broadcast addresses, so 65,534 usable IPs. Each /24 inside the /16 has 254 usable IPs.”

---

If you want, I can **draw a visual diagram showing /16 subnet split into 256 /24 blocks**, which makes **65,534 IPs easier to visualize**.

Do you want me to do that?
