Exactly — that’s an excellent question, and your hint is 100% correct.
Blocking an IAM user from accessing a specific S3 bucket should be done **via an S3 Bucket Policy**, not just an IAM policy.

Here’s how to explain it clearly 👇

---

### ✅ **Answer (Practical + Interview Style)**

> “To block a specific IAM user from accessing an S3 bucket, I would configure a **Bucket Policy** on that bucket denying access explicitly for that user’s ARN.
> Even if the user has S3 permissions through IAM, the explicit *Deny* in the bucket policy will override it.”

---

### **🔧 Steps (Console Way)**

1. Go to **S3 console → Buckets → [Bucket Name]**
2. Navigate to **Permissions → Bucket Policy**
3. Add a **Deny statement** specifying the IAM user’s ARN and the actions you want to block (for example, `s3:*`).

### **📝 Sample Bucket Policy**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenySpecificUserAccess",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/testuser"
      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **🔍 Explanation**

* `Effect: Deny` → Explicitly blocks access.
* `Principal` → IAM user you want to block.
* `Action: s3:*` → Denies all S3 actions (you can narrow this if needed).
* `Resource` → The bucket and its contents.

---

### **🧠 Key Points to Remember**

* **Bucket policy Deny > IAM Allow** — Deny always overrides Allow.
* Blocking at bucket level ensures other IAM users or roles remain unaffected.
* Best practice: use **least privilege** and **explicit deny** only when needed.

---

### **Example Summary (for interview)**

> “I’d block the IAM user by applying a Deny statement in the S3 bucket policy targeting that user’s ARN. This ensures that, regardless of their IAM permissions, the user cannot perform any S3 actions on that bucket. Deny in the bucket policy takes precedence over IAM Allow.”

Would you like me to include a version of this policy that blocks *only read (GetObject)* access instead of full denial?
