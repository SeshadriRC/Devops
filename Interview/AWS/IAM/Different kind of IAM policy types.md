# Why do we have 3 different kind of IAM policy types?

Good question 👍 — let’s break it down in both **layman’s terms** and **interview-ready** language.

### 🧠 **Layman’s Explanation:**

Think of **IAM policies** like *rules* that decide what a person or service can and can’t do in AWS.

Now, these rules can be **stored and managed in three different ways**, depending on **who creates them** and **how they’re attached**:

| Policy Type                 | Who Creates/Owns It                                        | Example                                                              | Analogy                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Managed Policy**      | Created and maintained by **AWS**                          | `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`                                             | Like a *ready-made rulebook* from AWS. You just pick and use it.                                              |
| **Customer Managed Policy** | Created and maintained by **you (the user)**               | A custom policy that allows S3 read/write only to your team’s bucket | Like writing your *own rulebook* tailored to your company’s needs.                                            |
| **Inline Policy**           | Attached **directly to one specific user, group, or role** | A rule that applies only to the `DevOpsRole`                         | Like *writing rules on a sticky note* and putting it on one employee’s desk — it applies only to that person. |

### 💼 **Interview Explanation:**

In AWS IAM, there are **three types of policies**, each serving a different purpose for flexibility and maintainability:

1. **AWS Managed Policies:**

   * Predefined and managed by AWS.
   * Simplify permission management for common use cases.
   * Example: `AmazonEC2FullAccess`, `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
   * Best for quickly granting standard permissions.

2. **Customer Managed Policies:**

   * Created and maintained by your organization.
   * Provide fine-grained, reusable control over permissions.
   * Can be attached to multiple users, groups, or roles.
   * Recommended for **organization-specific access control** because they are reusable and version-controlled.

3. **Inline Policies:**

   * Embedded directly inside a single IAM user, group, or role.
   * Used for **unique, one-off permissions** that shouldn’t be shared.
   * Harder to manage at scale since they’re tied to a single entity.
   * Best used when you want to ensure a policy **must stay** with that specific role or user.

### 🧩 **Summary Answer (Interview-Ready)**

> AWS provides three IAM policy types — AWS Managed, Customer Managed, and Inline — to balance convenience, customization, and control.
>
> * **AWS Managed Policies** are prebuilt by AWS for common scenarios.
> * **Customer Managed Policies** are custom, reusable policies that you define.
> * **Inline Policies** are directly attached to a specific IAM entity and used for unique or tightly controlled permissions.
