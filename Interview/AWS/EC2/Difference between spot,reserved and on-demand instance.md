Perfect! Here’s a clear **comparison of On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances** in AWS — great for interviews and quick understanding:

---

| Feature          | On-Demand                               | Reserved                                                               | Spot                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pricing**      | Pay per hour/second at full price       | Pay upfront or partially upfront for 1–3 years, cheaper than On-Demand | Cheapest option, up to 90% discount                  |
| **Availability** | Always available                        | Guaranteed, as long as term is active                                  | Depends on spare capacity; can be terminated anytime |
| **Commitment**   | None                                    | Long-term commitment                                                   | No commitment                                        |
| **Interruption** | Never                                   | Never                                                                  | Can be terminated with 2-minute notice               |
| **Use Case**     | Steady workloads, unpredictable traffic | Steady workloads, predictable usage                                    | Flexible, fault-tolerant, batch jobs, analytics      |
| **Reliability**  | High                                    | High                                                                   | Low (not suitable for critical stateful apps)        |
| **Billing**      | Pay for what you use                    | Cheaper per hour, upfront cost                                         | Cheapest, pay only while running                     |

### **Layman Analogy**

* **On-Demand:** Book a hotel room at normal price whenever you want.
* **Reserved:** Book a room for the whole year at a discounted rate.
* **Spot:** Grab leftover rooms at a huge discount, but hotel can ask you to leave if full-paying guests arrive.

### **Interview Perspective**

> “On-Demand instances are flexible and reliable but cost more. Reserved instances are pre-paid for a long term at a discount. Spot instances are the cheapest, leveraging unused capacity, but can be terminated at any time, so they are best for non-critical or fault-tolerant workloads. Using a combination of these types can optimize both cost and availability.”

If you want, I can also **explain why Auto Scaling Groups often use a mix of Spot + On-Demand** for reliability — it ties this topic with your previous ASG question.

Do you want me to do that?
