Good — that’s a strong start ✅

When an EC2 instance created by an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** keeps going into the **“Terminated”** state, you have to think in two layers:

1. 🔹 **ASG logic** — did the ASG *decide* to terminate it (scaling policy, health check)?
2. 🔹 **EC2 health/system issues** — did the instance *fail* due to OS or resource problems?

Let’s go step-by-step with **complete troubleshooting** and what actions to take for your 3 points 👇

---

## 🧩 1. Check if ASG is terminating it intentionally

### 🔍 Why

ASG might be doing this automatically due to scaling policy, health check, or failed lifecycle.

### ✅ How to check

* Go to **EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → Activity History**

  * Look for messages like:

    * `Terminating EC2 instance: unhealthy`
    * `Launching a new EC2 instance to replace terminated one`
* Check **CloudWatch → Alarms** tied to the ASG.
* Verify **Target Group health checks (if behind ALB)** — a failed health check will trigger termination.

### 🧰 Fix

* If health checks fail → verify the app or instance startup script.
* If scaling policy is aggressive → adjust cooldown or thresholds.

---

## 🧩 2. Check system resource usage (CPU, Memory, Disk)

You already mentioned good steps:

> “Check node usage with `top` command and identify high utilization process.”

✅ That’s correct — do this **before** termination if you can connect to the instance.

### 🔍 If high CPU:

* Check process using `top` or `ps -aux --sort=-%cpu`
* If it’s an app process, inform app team or tune code/config.
* If background jobs (like logs, antivirus, etc.), adjust cron jobs or service configuration.

---

## 🧩 3. Disk space full (EBS issue)

You said:

> “Disk space full, EBS — but don’t know what to do.”

Here’s what you do 👇

### ✅ Steps:

1. SSH to instance.
2. Check usage:

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
3. Find large directories:

   ```bash
   du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head
   ```
4. Common cleanup:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d     # Clean old logs
   sudo rm -rf /var/log/*.gz
   sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
   ```
5. If still full → increase EBS volume size:

   * Go to EC2 → Volumes → Modify Volume → increase size (e.g., +10 GB).
   * Then inside instance:

     ```bash
     sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
     sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
     ```
   * Verify new size: `df -h`

### 🧠 Tip:

If EBS fills up completely, instance might fail health check → ASG terminates it.

---

## 🧩 4. No memory left

You said:

> “No memory left — don’t know what to do.”

Here’s what you can do 👇

### ✅ Steps:

1. Check memory:

   ```bash
   free -m
   top -o %MEM
   ```
2. Identify which process consumes memory.
3. If you find app-related processes (like Java, Node, Python, etc.), check for:

   * Memory leaks
   * Too many threads
4. Add swap temporarily:

   ```bash
   sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   free -m   # verify swap added
   ```

   (This helps prevent sudden OOM (Out Of Memory) kills.)
5. Long-term fix:

   * Tune app memory usage.
   * Increase instance type (more RAM) or adjust ASG launch template.

## 🧩 5. Other critical checks

| Check                | Command / Location                       | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| System logs          | `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog` | Look for kernel panics, OOM kills, or shutdowns   |
| EC2 Status Checks    | EC2 → Instances → “Status Checks” tab    | Failed system status = AWS hardware/network issue |
| Launch configuration | Verify Launch Template used by ASG       | Ensure correct AMI, security groups, IAM role     |
| Lifecycle hooks      | Auto Scaling → Lifecycle hooks           | Check if scripts fail and cause termination       |

## 🧠 Example Interview Answer

> If an EC2 instance created by an ASG keeps going to the terminated state, I’ll first check the ASG activity history to see why it’s terminating — usually due to failed health checks or scaling policy.
> Then I’ll verify instance-level metrics — CPU, memory, and disk utilization via CloudWatch or SSH.
> If the disk is full, I’ll clean unnecessary logs or expand the EBS volume.
> If memory is exhausted, I’ll check for memory leaks or add swap.
> Finally, I’ll make sure the application and startup scripts finish properly, otherwise ASG health checks fail and the instance gets replaced.

Would you like me to give you a **quick checklist-style version** (ready-to-speak in interview format, step-by-step)? It’ll help you memorize and answer smoothly.

Perfect 👍 — here’s a **crisp, step-by-step checklist** version you can **say directly in an interview** or use for quick recall when troubleshooting ASG terminations 👇

## 🧭 **ASG EC2 Termination Troubleshooting – Quick Checklist**

### 🔹 Step 1: Check Auto Scaling Group (ASG) activity

* Go to **EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → Activity History**
* Look for reasons like:

  * *“Instance marked unhealthy”*
  * *“Terminating instance due to failed ELB health check”*
* Check **CloudWatch alarms** or **scaling policies** that might be triggering termination.

✅ **Action:**
If due to health check failure, verify the app or user data startup scripts.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Verify EC2 instance health

* Check **EC2 → Instance → Status Checks**

  * “System check failed” → AWS hardware/network issue.
  * “Instance check failed” → OS-level issue.

✅ **Action:**
If system check fails → rebuild using a healthy AZ or AMI.
If instance check fails → log in and troubleshoot OS.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Check resource usage

#### CPU:

```bash
top -o %CPU
```

Identify high CPU-consuming process → inform app team or tune it.

#### Memory:

```bash
free -m
top -o %MEM
```

If memory exhausted:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

(Temporary fix – add swap space)

#### Disk:

```bash
df -h
du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head
```

Clean logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
sudo rm -rf /var/log/*.gz /tmp/*
```

If still full → **extend EBS volume** and **resize filesystem**.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Check application startup & health check logic

* ASG might terminate if:

  * App didn’t start in time.
  * Health endpoint returned failure.
* Check user data logs:

  ```bash
  cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
  ```

✅ **Action:** Fix startup script delays or dependencies.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Review network and permissions

* Verify instance profile (IAM role) and security groups.
* Ensure it can reach backend services or load balancer.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Review ASG configuration

* Correct **Launch Template / Launch Configuration**
* Check **termination policy** (maybe terminating wrong instances first).
* Check **lifecycle hooks** — sometimes scripts fail, causing timeout and termination.

---

### 💬 **Strong Interview Summary (ready to say):**

> If EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group keep going into terminated state, I’ll first check the ASG activity history to see if it’s a scaling or health-check-driven termination.
> Then I’ll review EC2 status checks and CloudWatch metrics for CPU, memory, and disk usage.
> If it’s a resource issue, I’ll clean disk, add swap, or resize EBS.
> I’ll also verify that the application starts properly and passes health checks, because a failed startup script or slow service often makes ASG mark it unhealthy.
> Finally, I’ll ensure the ASG configuration and launch template are correct.

Would you like me to give a **short one-line summary per cause** (e.g., "High CPU → app issue", "Disk full → clean logs or expand EBS") that you can use as a **quick reference cheat sheet**?
