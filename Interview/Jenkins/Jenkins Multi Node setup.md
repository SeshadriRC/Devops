Have you use Jenkins in multi node setup? If yes, could you explain how to add a new slave/followed to master ?

Yes — good question, and your hint about **“Manage Nodes and Clouds”** is spot on.
Here’s how you can explain this clearly (both conceptually and step-by-step for Jenkins multi-node setup):

---

### ✅ **Yes, I’ve used Jenkins in a multi-node (master–agent) setup.**

We use **Jenkins master** for orchestration and **agent/slave nodes** to execute jobs — especially when different nodes are needed for different environments (e.g., Linux, Windows, Docker builds, etc.).

---

### **🔧 Purpose of Multi-Node Setup**

* Distribute build workload across multiple machines.
* Run platform-specific builds (e.g., Java on Linux, .NET on Windows).
* Isolate jobs using dedicated agents for security or performance reasons.

---

### **⚙️ How to Add a New Agent (Slave) to Master**

1. **Login to Jenkins Master**

   * Go to: **Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds**

2. **Create a New Node**

   * Click **“New Node”**
   * Enter a name (e.g., `linux-agent-01`)
   * Select **Permanent Agent** and click **OK**

3. **Configure Node Details**

   * **Remote root directory:**
     Path on the agent machine where Jenkins will store workspace files (e.g., `/home/jenkins`)
   * **Labels:**
     Optional — helps jobs target specific agents (e.g., `docker`, `python`, `build`)
   * **Usage:**
     Choose if the node should be used freely or only for specific labeled jobs.

4. **Launch Method (most common)**

   * **Option 1:** *Launch agent by connecting it to the master*
     → You’ll get a command like:

     ```bash
     java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://<master-url>:8080/computer/linux-agent-01/slave-agent.jnlp -secret <secret-key>
     ```

     Run this on the agent machine.

   * **Option 2:** *Launch agent via SSH (automated)*
     → Jenkins master connects to the node via SSH credentials configured in Jenkins.

   * **Option 3:** *Launch agent via Docker or Kubernetes*
     → When using Jenkins with dynamic agents.

5. **Save & Verify**

   * Once configured, Jenkins will try to connect.
   * If successful, you’ll see the node status as **“Connected”** (green check mark).
   * You can then assign builds to run on that node using the **“Restrict where this project can be run”** option with the node label.

### **🧩 Example Architecture**

```
Jenkins Master
 ├── linux-agent-01  (Builds Docker images)
 ├── linux-agent-02  (Runs Unit Tests)
 └── windows-agent-01 (Builds .NET apps)
```

---

### **💡 Tip**

If your environment uses **Kubernetes or Docker**, Jenkins can dynamically provision agents instead of static ones — under
**Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds → Configure Clouds**.

---

### **Example Summary (Interview Style Answer)**

> “Yes, we use Jenkins in a multi-node setup. The master handles orchestration and delegates build execution to agents. To add a new agent, I go to *Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds → New Node*, define the node properties, and use SSH or JNLP to connect it to the master. This helps distribute builds efficiently and isolate environments per project.”

Would you like me to include the **exact steps for SSH-based agent configuration** (most commonly used in production)?
