We have a stage in Jenkins which requires to use agents with atleast 500MB of RAM. How do you advise to do this in Jenkins ?

- Labeling Agents Restricting
- Stages to Specific Labels
- Resource Requests (Kubernetes)

Perfect 👍 — let’s go through each method clearly and practically.

You mentioned:

> We need a Jenkins stage that runs only on agents with **at least 500 MB of RAM**

There are **three common approaches** to handle this, depending on your Jenkins setup 👇

---

## 🏷️ **1️⃣ Labeling Agents**

### 💡 Concept

You assign a **label** to Jenkins agents (nodes) — for example, `high-memory` — and tell Jenkins to run certain stages **only on nodes with that label**.

### ⚙️ How to Set Up

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins → Nodes → Configure**
2. Under **Labels**, enter:

   ```
   high-memory
   ```

### 🧩 Example Pipeline

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent any
            steps {
                echo "Running on any available agent"
            }
        }

        stage('Test - High Memory') {
            agent { label 'high-memory' }  // ✅ Runs only on nodes labeled "high-memory"
            steps {
                echo "Running on high-memory node"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ **Use when:** You manually know which agents meet your RAM requirement.

---

## 🚫 **2️⃣ Restricting Stages to Specific Labels**

This is just a **per-stage extension** of labeling.
You can mix multiple labels or logical conditions.

### 🧩 Example

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    agent { label 'high-memory && linux' }  // ✅ Only runs if both labels match
    steps {
        echo "Deploying on high-memory Linux node"
    }
}
```

✅ **Use when:** You want to tightly control which agents run specific parts of your pipeline (for example, Linux + high-memory).

---

## ☸️ **3️⃣ Resource Requests (Kubernetes Agents)**

If your Jenkins runs on Kubernetes (Jenkins Kubernetes plugin), you can define **resource limits and requests** inside the pipeline.
This ensures that Jenkins **spins up a pod** with enough CPU/RAM before running the stage.

### 🧩 Example

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none

    stages {
        stage('Test in Kubernetes Pod') {
            agent {
                kubernetes {
                    yaml """
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: jnlp
    image: jenkins/inbound-agent
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "500Mi"   # ✅ Minimum 500MB RAM required
        cpu: "500m"
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "1"
"""
                }
            }
            steps {
                echo "Running on a Kubernetes pod with at least 500MB RAM"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ **Use when:** Jenkins is integrated with Kubernetes and dynamically provisions agents.

## 🧾 **Summary**

| Method                           | Where it applies                  | Example Usage                        | Best For                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Labeling Agents**              | Static Jenkins agents             | `agent { label 'high-memory' }`      | Manual or on-prem Jenkins nodes       |
| **Restricting Stages to Labels** | Stage-specific control            | `label 'linux && high-memory'`       | Fine-grained control                  |
| **Kubernetes Resource Requests** | Cloud or Kubernetes-based Jenkins | `resources.requests.memory: "500Mi"` | Dynamic agents with guaranteed memory |

Would you like me to show an example of combining **labels + Kubernetes resource requests** (common in hybrid Jenkins setups)?
