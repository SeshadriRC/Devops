Prometheus is a popular monitoring and alerting tool that **scrapes metrics from applications or systems**. It can get metrics in several ways, depending on how the target exposes them. Let’s break this down clearly.

---

## **1. Pull Model (Scraping)**

This is the **primary way Prometheus collects metrics**.

* Prometheus **periodically polls an HTTP endpoint** on the target to get metrics.
* Targets expose metrics in a **Prometheus-compatible text format**, usually at `/metrics`.

### Example

* A web application exposes metrics at:

```
http://my-app:8080/metrics
```

* Prometheus scrapes it every 15s (configurable in `prometheus.yml`):

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['my-app:8080']
```

✅ **Advantages:**

* Prometheus controls **how often it scrapes**.
* Pull model is simple and decoupled.

---

## **2. Push Model (via Pushgateway)**

Prometheus itself **cannot push metrics**, but you can use **Pushgateway** for short-lived jobs.

* Short-lived jobs (like batch jobs) **cannot be scraped directly** because they might finish before Prometheus scrapes.
* These jobs **push metrics to a Pushgateway**, which Prometheus scrapes.

### Example

* Job pushes metrics:

```
curl --data-binary @metrics.txt http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/batch1
```

* Prometheus scrapes Pushgateway periodically.

✅ **Use case:** short-lived batch jobs or cron jobs.

---

## **3. Exporters**

Prometheus **cannot natively understand all systems**, so **exporters** expose metrics in Prometheus format.

* Examples:

  * **node_exporter** → OS-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
  * **blackbox_exporter** → HTTP/S, ICMP, DNS monitoring
  * **mysqld_exporter** → MySQL metrics

* Prometheus scrapes the **exporter endpoint** like a regular HTTP endpoint.

---

## **4. Direct Instrumentation (Client Libraries)**

Applications can **directly expose metrics** using **Prometheus client libraries**:

* Languages supported: Python, Java, Go, Ruby, etc.
* Application code uses the library to define metrics (`Counter`, `Gauge`, `Histogram`) and exposes them at `/metrics`.
* Prometheus scrapes this endpoint.

### Example in Python

```python
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Counter

c = Counter('my_requests_total', 'Total HTTP requests')
start_http_server(8000)
c.inc()
```

### ✅ Summary of Ways Prometheus Gets Metrics

| Method                   | How it Works                             | Use Case                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Pull/Scrape**          | Prometheus scrapes HTTP endpoint         | Long-running services                |
| **Push via Pushgateway** | Short-lived jobs push metrics to gateway | Batch jobs, cron jobs                |
| **Exporters**            | Middleware exposes system metrics        | OS, DB, network devices, apps        |
| **Client Libraries**     | App exposes metrics directly             | Instrument application code directly |

If you want, I can **draw a small diagram showing all four ways** Prometheus can get metrics—it makes it very easy to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?
