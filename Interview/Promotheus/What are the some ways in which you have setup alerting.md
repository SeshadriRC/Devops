That’s right — alerting should follow a **standardized organization-wide flow**, not ad hoc setups per team. Here’s a concise, structured way to describe **common alerting setups** (useful for interviews or documentation):

---

### **Alerting Setup — Common Approaches**

#### 🧩 **1. Standard Process Flow**

* **Monitoring tool** detects an issue (e.g., high CPU, disk full, service down).
* **Alerting system** evaluates thresholds or rules.
* **Notification system** delivers alerts via approved channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.).
* **On-call engineers** acknowledge and resolve the issue.

---

### **2. Open-Source Implementations**

#### **Prometheus + Alertmanager**

* Prometheus collects metrics.
* Alert rules defined in `alert.rules.yml`.
* Alertmanager handles routing, grouping, silencing.
* Integrations:

  * Email, Slack, MS Teams
  * PagerDuty, Opsgenie, VictorOps

**Example flow:**
`Prometheus → Alertmanager → Slack + Email`

---

#### **Nagios / Icinga**

* Uses plugins to check host and service status.
* Thresholds defined in Nagios configs.
* Notification via:

  * Email
  * SMS gateway
  * Webhooks or integrations (Opsgenie, Slack)

---

#### **Grafana Alerting (with Prometheus or Loki)**

* Alerts can be configured directly in Grafana dashboards.
* Supports multi-channel notifications.

---

### **3. Cloud-Native Alerting**

#### **AWS CloudWatch → SNS**

* CloudWatch monitors metrics (EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.).
* Alarm triggers SNS topic.
* SNS notifies subscribers:

  * Email
  * SMS
  * Lambda function
  * Webhook (for Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)

#### **Azure Monitor / Google Cloud Monitoring**

* Similar pattern using **Action Groups / Notification Channels**.

---

### **4. Enterprise Tools**

* **Datadog**: Metric and log-based alerting; integrates with Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow.
* **New Relic**, **Dynatrace**, **Splunk On-Call**: Similar ecosystem-level alerting.

---

### **5. Notification Channels**

* **Email**
* **SMS / Phone call**
* **Slack / Teams**
* **PagerDuty / Opsgenie**
* **Webhook to ticketing systems (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira)**

---

### **Example summary line (for interviews):**

> “We use a centralized alerting flow — metrics from Prometheus are evaluated via Alertmanager, routed through Slack and email for critical alerts. In cloud environments, CloudWatch alarms trigger SNS topics for notifications.”

Would you like me to write a **sample alerting workflow diagram or text-based flow** for Prometheus → Alertmanager → Slack?
