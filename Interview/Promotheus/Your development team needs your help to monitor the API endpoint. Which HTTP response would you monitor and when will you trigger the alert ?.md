Your development team needs your help to monitor the API endpoint. Which HTTP response would you monitor and when will you trigger the alert ?

Exactly right 👍

Let’s make that explanation crisp and production-grade — the way you’d describe it in a **DevOps / SRE context** 👇

---

### 🧭 **Monitoring API Endpoints — HTTP Response-based Alerts**

Every application exposes one or more **API endpoints** (e.g., `/status`, `/health`, `/login`, `/home`, etc.) to verify its availability and behavior.
When these endpoints are monitored (usually via tools like Prometheus, Datadog, ELK, or Pingdom), the HTTP **status code** returned by the endpoint is the key health indicator.

### 🧩 **HTTP Status Code Categories**

| Category          | Code Range | Meaning                              |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Informational** | 100–199    | Request received, continuing process |
| **Success**       | 200–299    | Request succeeded (✅ healthy)        |
| **Redirection**   | 300–399    | Resource moved or redirected         |
| **Client Error**  | 400–499    | Problem with the client request      |
| **Server Error**  | 500–599    | Problem on the server side           |

---

### 🚨 **When to Trigger Alerts**

You generally monitor your API for **non-200** responses and trigger alerts in these cases:

| Range   | Description                                                     | Action                                                                                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4xx** | Client error (e.g., bad request, unauthorized, not found)       | ⚠️ Trigger warning — may indicate API misconfiguration, invalid authentication, or missing routes |
| **5xx** | Server error (e.g., internal server error, service unavailable) | 🔴 Trigger critical alert — API or backend failure                                                |

---

### ✅ **Example**

If you’re monitoring `/health` or `/status` endpoint:

* Normal:

  ```
  GET /status → 200 OK
  ```

  → System healthy, no alert.

* Alert conditions:

  ```
  GET /status → 500 Internal Server Error
  GET /status → 404 Not Found
  GET /status → 503 Service Unavailable
  ```

  → Trigger alert immediately.

---

### ⚙️ **Typical Implementation**

In Prometheus (for example):

```yaml
- alert: API_Down
  expr: probe_http_status_code{job="api-monitor"} >= 400
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    description: "API endpoint {{ $labels.instance }} returned {{ $value }}"
```

---

### 🧠 **In short**

> Monitor your API endpoint (like `/status`) for its HTTP response.
> **Trigger alert when response code ≥ 400** — i.e., when you hit client or server errors (4xx or 5xx).
