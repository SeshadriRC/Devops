Here’s a **concise, interview-oriented explanation** of **PV (Persistent Volume)** and **PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)** in Kubernetes — clear enough to answer confidently in an interview:

---

### 🧩 **Persistent Volume (PV)**

* A **Persistent Volume (PV)** is a **cluster-wide storage resource** that provides **durable storage** independent of pods and their lifecycles.
* It’s created and managed by the **cluster administrator**, and it represents actual physical storage — like **NFS, AWS EBS, Azure Disk, GCE Persistent Disk**, etc.
* Think of it as a **storage resource in the cluster**, similar to how nodes are compute resources.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-data
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/pv
```

---

### 📦 **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**

* A **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** is a **request for storage** made by a user or pod.
* It specifies **how much storage** and **what access mode** (e.g., ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, etc.) is needed.
* When a PVC is created, Kubernetes automatically **binds** it to a matching PV that satisfies the claim’s requirements.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-data
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

---

### ⚙️ **Key Relationship**

* **PV** = actual storage (supply)
* **PVC** = storage request (demand)
* Kubernetes **binds** PVC to PV automatically (based on size, access mode, and StorageClass).

---

### 💡 **Interview Tip — Common Questions**

**Q1:** Why do we need PV and PVC instead of directly mounting storage to pods?
👉 Because pods are **ephemeral**; when a pod restarts or reschedules, its storage would otherwise be lost. PV/PVC decouple storage from pod lifecycle, ensuring **data persistence**.

**Q2:** What happens when a PVC is deleted?
👉 Behavior depends on the PV’s **reclaim policy**:

* `Retain`: Keeps data for manual cleanup.
* `Delete`: Deletes the storage.
* `Recycle` (deprecated): Empties data and makes PV available again.

**Q3:** What is a StorageClass?
👉 It automates **dynamic provisioning** of PVs — instead of manually creating PVs, Kubernetes creates one automatically when a PVC requests it.

Would you like me to include **a short diagram** showing how PV, PVC, Pod, and StorageClass connect? It’s great for interview recall.
