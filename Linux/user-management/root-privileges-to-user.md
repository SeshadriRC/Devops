On Ubuntu (or other Debian-based systems), `sudo` normally asks for your user password for security. If you want to run `sudo su -` **without being prompted for a password**, you need to configure passwordless `sudo` for your user. Here’s how to do it safely:

1. Open the sudoers file using `visudo` (always use `visudo` to avoid syntax errors):

```bash
sudo visudo
```

2. Add this line at the end (replace `sesha` with your username):

```text
sesha ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

3. Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).

4. Now, running `sudo su -` should **not ask for a password**:

```bash
sudo su -
```

✅ **Important:** Allowing passwordless sudo is a **security risk**, especially on shared or networked machines. Use it only if you understand the implications.

If you want, I can also give a **safer way** to only allow passwordless switching to root, without full passwordless sudo for all commands. Do you want me to show that?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This line is from the **sudoers file** (`/etc/sudoers`) and controls how `sudo` works for your user. Let’s break it down:

```
sesha ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

* `sesha` → the username this rule applies to.
* `ALL` (first one) → the rule applies on **all hosts** (useful if sudoers is shared across multiple machines).
* `(ALL)` → the user can run commands as **any user** (including root).
* `NOPASSWD:` → **don’t ask for a password** when running sudo commands.
* `ALL` (last one) → the user can run **any command**.

✅ So in simple terms:

> The user `sesha` can run **any command as any user** without being asked for a password.

⚠️ **Security note:** This is powerful and can be risky on shared or networked machines because it essentially gives root access without a password.

If you want, I can show a **safer alternative** that only allows passwordless `sudo su -` but not all commands. Do you want me to?
