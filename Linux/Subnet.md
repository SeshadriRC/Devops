## Subnet

Great, now we’re at the heart of it 👍 — let me explain **what a subnet is** in very simple words.

---

## 🔹 Subnet (short for *sub-network*)

A **subnet** is just a *smaller piece of a bigger network*.

Think of it like:

* You have a **big apartment building (whole IP network)**.
* Each **floor (subnet)** has its own set of flats (IP addresses).
* Inside a subnet, the flats (IP addresses) can talk to each other directly.
* To talk between floors (subnets), you need a **router** (gateway).

---

## 🔹 In IP terms

* Every IP address has **two parts**:

  ```
  [Network part] + [Host part]
  ```
* The **subnet mask (or /CIDR prefix)** decides how much of the address is for *network* and how much is for *hosts*.

Example:
`172.28.0.0/24`

* Network part = first 24 bits (`172.28.0`)
* Host part = last 8 bits (`.0 – .255`)
* So this subnet = **all addresses from 172.28.0.0 → 172.28.0.255**

---

## 🔹 Why do we use subnets?

1. **Organization** → divide a big network into smaller ones (like HR dept vs IT dept).
2. **Security** → isolate machines in one subnet from another.
3. **Efficiency** → reduce unnecessary traffic.

---

## 🔹 In Docker’s case

When you run:

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=172.28.0.0/24 \
  --ip-range=172.28.0.0/24 \
  ecommerce
```

* `172.28.0.0/24` is the **subnet** (the pool of IPs Docker can use for this network).
* Inside this subnet, Docker will assign IPs like `172.28.0.2`, `172.28.0.3`, etc. to your containers.

---

✅ So:

* **Subnet = the pool of IPs you define (a smaller piece of the bigger network).**
* **CIDR (/24, /25, etc.) = tells how big or small that subnet is.**

---

👉 Do you want me to also explain **difference between subnet and ip-range** (with a real Docker example showing how containers actually get IPs)?


## Subnet-calculation

Perfect 👌 this is the root of it — let’s go very step-by-step.

---

## 🔹 What does `172.28.0.0/24` mean?

It’s called **CIDR notation**:

```
[Network address] / [Prefix length]
```

* `172.28.0.0` → the **network address** (starting point of the subnet)
* `/24` → the **prefix length** = how many bits are reserved for the **network part** of the IP address

---

## 🔹 Breaking it down

An IPv4 address = 32 bits total.
Example: `172.28.0.0` in binary =

```
10101100.00011100.00000000.00000000
```

Now `/24` means:

* **First 24 bits** are the **network portion** (fixed)
* **Remaining 8 bits** are for **hosts** (variable)

---

## 🔹 Why does `/24` give 256 addresses?

* Remaining host bits = `32 − 24 = 8`
* 2^8 = **256 possible combinations** (from `00000000` to `11111111`).

That’s why `/24` covers:

```
172.28.0.0 → 172.28.0.255
```

(256 total addresses, but only 254 usable because `.0` = network, `.255` = broadcast).

---

## 🔹 Compare with `/25`

If it’s `/25`:

* Network bits = 25
* Host bits = 7
* 2^7 = 128 total addresses

So:

```
172.28.0.0/25 → 172.28.0.0 – 172.28.0.127
172.28.0.128/25 → 172.28.0.128 – 172.28.0.255
```

Each `/25` subnet has 128 addresses (126 usable).

---

✅ **In short:**

* The number after `/` = how many bits are reserved for the network.
* The rest of the bits = how many addresses you get for hosts.

👉 Do you want me to draw you a **visual block diagram** (binary breakdown of network vs host bits for /24 and /25) so it clicks instantly?
