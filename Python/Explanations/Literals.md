In programming, a **literal** is a **fixed value written directly in the code**—something that represents itself exactly. It’s **not stored in a variable or computed**; it’s “literal.”

### Examples in Python:

1. **String literals**

```python
"Hello"       # double-quoted string literal
'Python'      # single-quoted string literal
"""Multi-line string"""  # triple-quoted string literal
```

2. **Numeric literals**

```python
42            # integer literal
3.14          # floating-point literal
0b1010        # binary literal
0o12          # octal literal
0x1A          # hexadecimal literal
```

3. **Boolean literals**

```python
True
False
```

4. **Special literal**

```python
None
```

### Key points

* **Literal = exact value written in code**
* Not the same as a variable (which stores a value).

```python
x = 10    # 10 is a literal, x is a variable storing that literal
```

* Adjacent **string literals** are automatically concatenated in Python:

```python
"Hello" " World"  # becomes "Hello World"
```

If you want, I can draw a **small diagram showing literals vs variables**—it makes it very easy to visualize. Do you want me to do that?
