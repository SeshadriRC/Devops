## Question 1

What will be the output of the following Python code?

a = []
for i in range(5):
    a.append([])
    for j in range(5):
        a[i].append(j)

print(a[3][3])

Let’s go step by step 👇

```python
a = []
for i in range(5):
    a.append([])          # creates a new inner list for each i
    for j in range(5):
        a[i].append(j)    # appends 0,1,2,3,4 to that list

print(a[3][3])
```

### Step-by-step:

1. Outer loop runs 5 times (`i = 0 → 4`).
2. For each `i`, an empty list is added to `a`, then inner loop (`j`) appends numbers 0–4.

After loop:

```python
a = [
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4]
]
```

Now:

```python
a[3] = [0,1,2,3,4]
a[3][3] = 3
```

✅ **Output:**

```
3
```

## Question 2

What will be the output of the following Python code?

matrix = [[j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)] 
print(matrix[1][2])

Let’s break it down 👇

```python
matrix = [[j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]
print(matrix[1][2])
```

### Step-by-step:

* Inner list comprehension:
  `[j for j in range(3)]` → `[0, 1, 2]`

* Outer list comprehension repeats that 3 times:
  `[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]`

So:

```python
matrix = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [0, 1, 2],
  [0, 1, 2]
]
```

Now:
`matrix[1][2]` → 2nd row (index 1), 3rd element (index 2) = **2**

✅ **Output:**

```
2
```


## Question 3

What will be the output of the following Python code?

countries = [['Egypt', 'USA', 'India'],
       ['Dubai', 'America', 'Spain'], 
       ['London', 'England', 'France']]
countries2  = [country for sublist in countries for country in 
                       sublist if len(country) < 6]
print(countries2)

Let’s go step by step 👇

```python
countries = [['Egypt', 'USA', 'India'],
             ['Dubai', 'America', 'Spain'], 
             ['London', 'England', 'France']]

countries2  = [country for sublist in countries 
                         for country in sublist 
                         if len(country) < 6]

print(countries2)
```

### Step-by-step reasoning:

We flatten the nested list but **only include names with length < 6**.

Let’s check each:

| Country | Length | Include? |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| Egypt   | 5      | ✅        |
| USA     | 3      | ✅        |
| India   | 5      | ✅        |
| Dubai   | 5      | ✅        |
| America | 7      | ❌        |
| Spain   | 5      | ✅        |
| London  | 6      | ❌        |
| England | 7      | ❌        |
| France  | 6      | ❌        |

✅ Included: `['Egypt', 'USA', 'India', 'Dubai', 'Spain']`

---

✅ **Output:**

```python
['Egypt', 'USA', 'India', 'Dubai', 'Spain']
```



## Question 4

What will be the output of the following Python code?

a = []
for i in range(5):
    a.append([])
    for j in range(5):
        a[i].append(j)

print(a[2][3])

Let’s go step by step 👇

```python
a = []
for i in range(5):
    a.append([])          # creates a new inner list for each i
    for j in range(5):
        a[i].append(j)    # appends 0,1,2,3,4 to that list

print(a[2][3])
```

### Step-by-step:

After the loops:

```python
a = [
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
]
```

Now:

* `a[2]` → `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
* `a[2][3]` → `3`

✅ **Output:**

```
3
```

## Question 5


What will be the output of the following Python code?

matrix = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

matrix2 = []

for submatrix in matrix:
  for val in submatrix:
    matrix2.append(val)

print(matrix2[2])

Let’s analyze the code step by step 👇

```python
matrix = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

matrix2 = []

for submatrix in matrix:
    for val in submatrix:
        matrix2.append(val)

print(matrix2[2])
```

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Outer loop iterates over each sublist: `[0,1,2]`
2. Inner loop appends each value to `matrix2`.

After the loops, `matrix2` will be **flattened**:

```python
matrix2 = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
```

Now:

* `matrix2[2]` → 3rd element (0-indexed) → `2`

✅ **Output:**

```
2
```


## Question 6

What will be the output of the following Python code?

matrix = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

matrix2 = []

for submatrix in matrix:
  for val in submatrix:
    matrix2.append(val)

print(matrix2[0])

Let’s go step by step 👇  

```python
matrix = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

matrix2 = []

for submatrix in matrix:
    for val in submatrix:
        matrix2.append(val)

print(matrix2[0])
```

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Outer loop iterates over each sublist: `[0,1,2]`
2. Inner loop appends each value to `matrix2`.

After the loops, `matrix2` will be **flattened**:

```python
matrix2 = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
```

Now:

- `matrix2[0]` → 1st element (0-indexed) → `0`

✅ **Output:**
```
0
```

Absolutely! Let’s break it down **carefully** so it’s crystal clear.

We have the code:

```python
matrix = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

matrix2 = []

for submatrix in matrix:
    for val in submatrix:
        matrix2.append(val)

print(matrix2[0])
```

---

### **Step 1: Understand the structure**

* `matrix` is a **list of lists**:

```
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 2],  # sublist 0
    [0, 1, 2],  # sublist 1
    [0, 1, 2]   # sublist 2
]
```

* `matrix2` starts as an **empty list**: `[]`.

---

### **Step 2: Flattening the matrix**

The loops:

```python
for submatrix in matrix:
    for val in submatrix:
        matrix2.append(val)
```

* Outer loop: `for submatrix in matrix` → iterates over each sublist.

  * First iteration: `submatrix = [0,1,2]`
  * Second iteration: `submatrix = [0,1,2]`
  * Third iteration: `submatrix = [0,1,2]`

* Inner loop: `for val in submatrix` → iterates over each element of the current sublist and appends it to `matrix2`.

Step by step:

1. First sublist `[0,1,2]` → append 0, 1, 2 → `matrix2 = [0, 1, 2]`
2. Second sublist `[0,1,2]` → append 0, 1, 2 → `matrix2 = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`
3. Third sublist `[0,1,2]` → append 0, 1, 2 → `matrix2 = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`

So basically, **we are flattening the 2D list into a 1D list**.

---

### **Step 3: Access the element**

* `matrix2[0]` → accesses the first element of the flattened list.
* `matrix2 = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`
* `matrix2[0] = 0`

---

### ✅ **Key Concept**

* **Nested loops over lists** are a common way to flatten a 2D list.
* `matrix2.append(val)` simply **adds each element sequentially** from the sublists.
* Indexing a flattened list works like normal 1D lists.

---

If you want, I can also **draw a simple diagram showing how each element moves from `matrix` → `matrix2`**, which makes this much easier to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

## Question 7

What will be the output of the following Python code?

matrix = [[j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)] 
print(matrix[2][1])

Let’s go step by step 👇

```python
matrix = [[j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]
print(matrix[2][1])
```

---

### **Step 1: Build the matrix**

* Inner list comprehension: `[j for j in range(3)]` → `[0, 1, 2]`
* Outer list comprehension repeats it 3 times → 3 rows

So `matrix` becomes:

```python
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 2],  # row 0
    [0, 1, 2],  # row 1
    [0, 1, 2]   # row 2
]
```

---

### **Step 2: Access element**

* `matrix[2]` → 3rd row → `[0, 1, 2]`
* `matrix[2][1]` → 2nd element of that row → `1`

---

✅ **Output:**

```
1
```


## Question 8



Sure! Let’s break down **exactly how this list comprehension works**.

We have this code:

```python
countries = [
    ['Egypt', 'USA', 'India'],
    ['Dubai', 'America', 'Spain'],
    ['London', 'England', 'France']
]

countries2 = [country for sublist in countries
              for country in sublist
              if len(country) < 4]

print(countries2)
```

---
## Question 9

What will be the output of the following Python code?

countries = [['Egypt', 'USA', 'India'], ['Dubai', 'America', 'Spain'], ['London', 'England', 'France']]
countries2  = [country for sublist in countries for country in sublist if len(country) < 4]
print(countries2)

### **Step 1: Understand the structure**

* `countries` is a **list of lists** (a 2D list):

```
countries = [
  ['Egypt', 'USA', 'India'],      # sublist 0
  ['Dubai', 'America', 'Spain'],  # sublist 1
  ['London', 'England', 'France'] # sublist 2
]
```

* `countries2` will store the **filtered results**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the list comprehension**

```python
[country for sublist in countries
         for country in sublist
         if len(country) < 4]
```

This is equivalent to **nested loops**:

```python
countries2 = []
for sublist in countries:           # Outer loop: iterate over each sublist
    for country in sublist:         # Inner loop: iterate over each country in the sublist
        if len(country) < 4:        # Check if the length of the country name is < 4
            countries2.append(country)
```

---

### **Step 3: Iterate through each element**

| Sublist                         | Country | Length | Include? |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| ['Egypt', 'USA', 'India']       | Egypt   | 5      | ❌        |
|                                 | USA     | 3      | ✅        |
|                                 | India   | 5      | ❌        |
| ['Dubai', 'America', 'Spain']   | Dubai   | 5      | ❌        |
|                                 | America | 7      | ❌        |
|                                 | Spain   | 5      | ❌        |
| ['London', 'England', 'France'] | London  | 6      | ❌        |
|                                 | England | 7      | ❌        |
|                                 | France  | 6      | ❌        |

* Only `USA` satisfies `len(country) < 4`

---

### **Step 4: Result**

```python
countries2 = ['USA']
```

---

✅ **Key Concept**

* **Nested list comprehension** = flattened iteration + optional filter (`if condition`)
* Filters each element as it is processed
* Only elements satisfying the condition are added to the resulting list

---

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram showing how each sublist and element is processed step by step**, which makes it much easier to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

## Question 10

What will be the output of the following Python code? a = [] for i in range(2): a.append([]) for j in range(2): a[i].append(j) print(a)

Let's break it down step by step 👇  

```python
a = []
for i in range(2):
    a.append([])          # creates a new inner list for each i
    for j in range(2):
        a[i].append(j)    # appends 0, 1 to that inner list

print(a)
```

---

### **Step 1: Outer loop**

- `range(2)` → `i = 0, 1`
- For each `i`, we append a new empty list: `a.append([])`

---

### **Step 2: Inner loop**

- `range(2)` → `j = 0, 1`
- `a[i].append(j)` adds `j` to the current inner list

Step by step:

1. `i = 0` → new list `[]`  
   - `j = 0` → append 0 → `[0]`  
   - `j = 1` → append 1 → `[0, 1]`  
   → `a = [[0, 1]]`

2. `i = 1` → new list `[]`  
   - `j = 0` → append 0 → `[0]`  
   - `j = 1` → append 1 → `[0, 1]`  
   → `a = [[0, 1], [0, 1]]`

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Final Output**

```python
[[0, 1], [0, 1]]
```

## Question 10

What will be the output of the following Python code?

matrix = [[j for j in range(4)] for i in range(4)] 
print(matrix[3][1])

Let's break it down step by step 👇  

```python
matrix = [[j for j in range(4)] for i in range(4)]
print(matrix[3][1])
```

---

### **Step 1: Build the matrix**

- Inner list comprehension: `[j for j in range(4)]` → `[0, 1, 2, 3]`  
- Outer list comprehension repeats it 4 times → 4 rows  

So `matrix` becomes:

```python
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 0
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 1
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 2
    [0, 1, 2, 3]   # row 3
]
```

---

### **Step 2: Access element**

- `matrix[3]` → 4th row → `[0, 1, 2, 3]`  
- `matrix[3][1]` → 2nd element of that row → `1`

---

✅ **Output:**
```
1
```

Sure! Let me explain **step by step** so it’s very clear.

We have:

```python
matrix = [[j for j in range(4)] for i in range(4)]
print(matrix[3][1])
```

---

### **Step 1: Understand the structure**

* `matrix` is a **list of lists** (2D list).
* Inner list comprehension: `[j for j in range(4)]` → `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
* Outer list comprehension: `for i in range(4)` → repeats the inner list 4 times.

So, after execution:

```python
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 0
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 1
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 2
    [0, 1, 2, 3]   # row 3
]
```

---

### **Step 2: Accessing elements**

* `matrix[3]` → 4th row (0-indexed) → `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
* `matrix[3][1]` → 2nd element of that row → `1`

---

### **Step 3: Why it works**

1. **List comprehension `[j for j in range(4)]`** creates a **single row** with numbers 0 to 3.
2. **Outer list comprehension** repeats this row 4 times to form a 4×4 matrix.
3. Indexing `[row_index][column_index]` allows you to select any element.

---

### **Visualization**

```
matrix = [
  [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 0
  [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 1
  [0, 1, 2, 3],  # row 2
  [0, 1, 2, 3]   # row 3
]

matrix[3][1] = 1
```

---

So the output is:

```
1
```

---

If you want, I can also **draw a diagram showing how the inner and outer comprehensions build the 2D list visually**, which makes it even easier to understand.

Do you want me to do that?
